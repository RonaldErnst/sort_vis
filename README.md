# Sorting Visualizer

An interactive sorting algorithm visualizer.
Built with React and deployed to Vercel.

This little project helped me get more familiar with React.

Install and run locally or have a look at this [Demo](https://sort-vis-ronaldernst.vercel.app/).

## How to install and run locally
